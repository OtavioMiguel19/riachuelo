## Getting Started

### Running the Application with Docker

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2.  Run the following command:


```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build the Docker image and start the application in a container.

### Accessing the Frontend

## Technical Decisions
* I chose to use Bootstrap to ensure a pleasant visual experience and responsiveness.
* I used Docker to make building and running the entire project easier.

## Use of AI

The following tasks involved the use of AI assistance:
* Since I don't work with Angular on a daily basis, I had several questions. Due to time constraints, I used AI to help me with these development-related doubts.
* Assistance with debugging issues.
* Help improving my HTML during moments when I ran out of design ideas.
